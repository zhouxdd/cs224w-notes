I"”<p>In this section, we study how a infection propagates through a network. We will look into two classed of model, namely decision based models and probabilistic models. But first lets look at some terminology used throughout the post.</p>

<p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Cascade: Propagation tree created by spreading contagion</li>
  <li>Contagion: What is spreading in the network, e.g., diseases, tweet, etc.</li>
  <li>Infection: Adoption/activation of a node</li>
  <li>Main players: Infected/active nodes, early adopters</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="decision-based-models">Decision Based Models</h1>
<p>In decision based models, every nodes independently decides whether to adopt the contagion or not depending upon its neighbors. The decision is modelled as a two-player coordination game between user and its neighbor and related payoffs. Hence a node with degree <script type="math/tex">k</script> plays <script type="math/tex">k</script> such games to decide its payoff and correspondingly its behavior.</p>

<h2 id="single-contagion-model">Single Contagion Model</h2>
<p>There are two contagions <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> in the network and initially every node has behavior <script type="math/tex">B</script>. Every node can have only one behavior out of the two. The payoff matrix is given as:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Â </th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>b</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Lets analyze a node with d neighbors, and let p be the fraction of nodes who have adopted <script type="math/tex">A</script>. Hence the payoff for <script type="math/tex">A</script> is <script type="math/tex">apd</script> and payoff for <script type="math/tex">B</script> is <script type="math/tex">b(1-p)d</script>. Hence the node adopts behavior <script type="math/tex">A</script> if 
<script type="math/tex">apd > b(1-p)d \implies p > \frac{b}{a+b} = q</script>(threshold)</p>

<p>Key Insights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uniform activation threhold for users, with two peaks</li>
  <li>Most cascades are short</li>
  <li>Successful cascades are started by central users</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p><strong>k-core decomposition</strong>: biggest connected subgraph where every node has at least degree k (iteratively remove nodes with degree less than k)</p>

<h3 id="multiple-contagion-model">Multiple Contagion Model</h3>
<p>There are two contagions <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> in the network and initially every node has behavior <script type="math/tex">B</script>. In this case a node can have both behavior <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> at a total cost of <script type="math/tex">c</script> (over all interactions). The payoff matrix is given as:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Â </th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>AB</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>a</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>b</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AB</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>max(a,b)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
